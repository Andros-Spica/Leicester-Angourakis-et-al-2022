							First, we defined what we believe are essential elements of rural, food-producing settlements.
							Our approach was to re-imagine an integral, yet blurry picture of what village life in the Indus 
							would look like, based on known archaeological evidence, but also on minimum assumptions informed 
							by parallels in space and time.
							|
							In a broad sense, these elements include:
							| Climate: more specifically the weather conditions related to solar radiation, temperature and precipitation. 
							| Land: which includes soil, water and cover.
							| Food production: mainly crops, which translate the condition of land and climate into foodstuff.
							| A human population: organised in households and groups and inhabiting a settlement.
							| The demography rulling the dynamics of this population,
							| The nutritional budget that regulates its health,
							| The diet that feeds into it,
							| and the food production economy that describes how production, distribution and storage of foodstuffs happens.
							| A exchange system that connects agents to other agents, and to agents in settlements outside the local economy.
							| And finally, bonding all together, the decision-making process that households would go through 
							to chose and revise their food production strategies, particularly in terms of the triplet use-conditions-investment.
							|
							Everything strictly within a small scale, 
							with one-hectare land units covering a total area of twenty-five kilometres squared, 
							and with processes being iterated up to a daily basis.

							Deriving from this general picture, we represented all these aspects 
							as submodels or parts of submodels, highlighted here in blue.
							These submodels are intentionally designed as modules,
							meaning they can function independently as models, if the required input is given.
							Besides the advantage in terms of code stability and extensibility,
							our hope is that each of these submodels can be more easily re-used by others in the future.
							|
							The full version of the Indus Village model is still under development.
							Here I will concentrate on those parts that are fully consolidated and explored. 
							We are thus leaving aside the submodels dealing strictly with human-related mechanisms.
							| 
							The model is implemented in NetLogo in a modular and progressive manner, 
							while each part is also thoroughly documented with pseudo-code diagrams and 
							R markdown demonstrations. 
							| 
							To properly understand the model at each stage of complexity, 
							we are performing extensive sensitivity analyses. 
							| 
							To inform and test our hypotheses, we perform experiments designed to 
							represent scenarios, particularly by varying parameters, programming trends and changes,
							and using alternative designs.

							Agriculture was the main pilar of the Indus food economy, in combination with animal husbandry,
							and other activities such as fishing.
							The crops cultivated were ancient varieties of wheat and barley (grown during winter or rabi season),
							various millets and rice (grown in pre and post monsoon or zaid and kharif seasons), 
							among many others.
							One key aspect raised in previous research is how farmers managed seasonality and climate

							With the purpose of representing multi-cropping practices, 
							we have chosen to use the SIMPLE crop model,
							which simplifies crop dynamics enough so we can operate with multiple crops, 
							without the necessity of dealing with multiple models and a high number of parameters.
							The SIMPLE crop model calculates the daily biomass based on growth stages 
							defined in thermal time and the modulation of the radiation use efficiency by temperature, 
							carbon dioxide concentrations and water stress.
							| 
							After implementing this model in NetLogo, we adapted it to a spatial scheme where multicropping is possible.
							Following the approach of the original authors, crop variety takes form in the 
							configuration of a relatively small number of parameters.
							The crops selected here, i.e. cereals, were chosen for our initial experiments 
							and are not controlled by empirical data on ancient cultivars of the Indus River Basin. 
							Instead, they represent archetypes of crops identified so far in the archaeological 
							record which might had a significant role throughout the Mature Harappan. 
							These crops were also selected to cover a range of meaningful parameter diversity 
							within SIMPLE's definitions. 
							Even though not calibrated, values are informed by crop modelling systems 
							and crop-specific studies.

						<aside class="notes">
							Within the scope of Indus Village, parametrisation focused mainly on 
							representing crops that differ in growing season and water stress sensitivity.
							For rabi, we included wheat and barley, with medium sensitivity;
							For zaid, proso millet, with low sensitivity; 
							For kharif, rice and pearl millet, respectively with high and low sensitivity.
							| 
							One of the key roles of the Crop model is to mediate 
							between the trajectory of ARID during the growing season of a crop and the yield produced.
							By design, the relationship between ARID and yield is mediated by 
							the crop's water sensitivity, and here you can see the implications of
							choosing certain crops under highly variable year-round conditions.
							Crops with higher water sensitivity (like rice) will only reach 
							the majority of their potential yield if ARID is kept close to minimum 
							and are more likely to fail in dry years.

							The Land Crop model comes as an integration of the Crop model with the Land Water model,
							|
							which in turn is an integration of the Land, Weather, and Soil Water models (that we will not cover here).
							Suffice to know that the Land Water model introduces river water inflow and solves both
							run-off and inundation exchanges between land units.
							|
							The integration of the Land Crop model was relatively straightforward.
							The outputs of all former submodels feed directly into the required inputs of the Crop model,
							and few adjustments are required.
							|
							All crops growing in a land unit are considered as an additional component 
							forming the unit's ecological community. Within the scheme set in the Land Water model, 
							expanding surface water continues to have preference over all other 
							components. In turn, given its artificial nature, crop area has preference over all remaining 
							components (i.e. through clearing, deforesting, and weeding).
							| 
							In absence of humans, crop choice and management are represented in the Land Crop model mainly as three variables, 
							namely selection, intensity, and frequency. 
							Selection is the list of crops to be simulated in land units.
							Intensity is the percentage of the land unit area to be used by all crops selected, 
							unless diminished by inundation. This has been kept constant at 50% throughout all experiments until now.
							Frequency is a list containing the percentage of 
							effective intensity (i.e. intensity minus any overlap with surface water) 
							that is dedicated for each crop in selection.
							The model also inherits other management aspects from the Crop model,
							that for now were not systematically explored.

							Human agency is not explicitly modelled in this version, 
							even though it is central to the broader Indus Village design. 
							To approach crop management, 
							we designed a experiment where frequency per crop is randomised at each land unit.
							| 
							This experiments aims at evidencing if and when there are
							"crop niche gradients" that could be relevant for crop choice and
							the overall resilience of food production.
							We measured this by plotting for each land unit and terrain
							the correlation between the land unit total yield and
							the frequency of a crop. 
							This means that when there is a positive correlation, 
							the crop niche is stronger, and vice versa.
							|
							These results highlight the divide between thirsty and drought-resistant crops.
							You can see here how rice and, to a lesser extent, wheat and barley concentrate 
							their niches around flooding areas, while millets, especially proso millet, 
							are moved further away to drier areas.
							These results are promising for our goal with the IndusVillage,
							since it shows the terms under which farming households need to decide 
							on their cropping strategies and how those may change with land and weather conditions.

						The Land Crop model and the results obtained so far help us define a management dilemma 
						that will have a key role in the broader Indus Village model. Such dilemma
						(hereafter referred to as crop choice dilemma) is to be encountered by 
						each farming agent when choosing which crops to grow in a land unit, 
						given the mandate of producing a certain amount of yield from a speciﬁc 
						set of crops with diverse characteristics.
						|
						(Crop selection and diversity). There are a number of crops to be produced 
						that are both available and required by society, given a broader
						economic and cultural context, and these are diverse as per their intrinsic
						biological traits, affecting important aspects of its cultivation.
						|
						(Limited means of production and workforce). Farming agents count with
						a limited amount of land, labour, and other resources to be invested
						in growing crops at any given time.
						|
						(Seasonality and climate variability). Weather is highly variable within a year,
						with precipitation concentrating in seasons (two rainy seasons, two dry seasons),
						while there is a high inter-annual variation in weather, with great differences
						in the amount and distribution of precipitation between consecutive years.
						|
						(Local and regional environmental diversity). Inundation areas represent a 
						special type of local environment, offering privileged crop growing conditions
						with low-to-none water stress.
						The conditions shaping weather (seasonality and climate-driven variability), 
						relief, soil properties, and ecology vary greatly between localities 
						within the same cultural region, confronting the same cultural 
						substratum to many potential contexts for the crop choice dilemma.

					<h3><i style="color: crimson">Risk</i> in the crop choice dilemma</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 80%;">
						risk associated with <b>water stress sensitivity</b>:<br><b style="color: crimson">high-risk</b> ("thirsty") vs <b style="color: crimson">low-risk</b> ("drought-resistant")
					</p>
					<ul style="font-size: 80%;">
						<li class="fragment">Why choose high-risk crops at all?</li>
						<li class="fragment">condition A: <i style="color: dodgerblue">crop value</i> outweights the risk (e.g. cash crop)</li>
						<li class="fragment">condition B: risk can be <i style="color:violet">mitigated</i></li>
					</ul>
						
					<aside class="notes">
						Within the scope of our approach, sensitivity to soil water stress is 
						the intrinsic factor driving most of the variability in productivity and 
						thus determining the risk that investing in it entails.
						Solely according to this parameter, we are able 
						to rank crops from low to high-risk (millets to winter cereals to rice),
						and correlate it with their yields under a wide variety of conditions. 
						In light of our results, low-risk crops are either more predictable (pearl millet) 
						or sustainably productive (proso millet) under virtually any regime of water 
						availability offered in our experiments.
						In contrast, high-risk crops like rice, and in less measure winter cereals, 
						offer either low or inconsistent yields depending on if there is a systemic 
						lack of water (i.e. low average annual precipitation, dry seasons, dry areas) 
						or more temporary, unpredictable drying conditions.
						| 
						Still, a question remains:
						Why do farmers grow more sensitive/high risk crops
						(presumibly, as the IC farmers did)?
						|
						The risk associated with a crop is weighted by farmers not only in relation 
						to the sheer amount of biomass harvested, but also to its value per capita 
						for consumption and exchange as well as cultural reasons.
						One extreme scenario is where entire regions specialise in the production 
						of one or few highly valued crops (cash crops), and obtain through trade 
						all other goods required by its economy.
						|
						Another side of the risk equation is that the risk itself can be reduced, 
						to a point in which an otherwise risky crop can be safely cultivated, 
						even if its value is not particularly high.

					<h3><i style="color: crimson">Risk-mitigation</i> in the crop choice dilemma</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 80%;">
						Strategies:
					</p>
					<ul style="font-size: 80%;">
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment"><i style="color: slateblue">hydrophile</i>: keep the water flowing<br>
								&rightarrow; <i style="color: crimson">minimise</i> the risk of high-risk crops
							</li>
							<li class="fragment"><i style="color: orange">polyphile</i>: keep it (agro)diverse<br>
								&rightarrow; <i style="color: crimson">compensate</i> the risk of high-risk crops
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">To be often combined locally,<br>also with other agronomic and economic strategies</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
						
					<aside class="notes">
						Probably the most intuitive measure to minimise soil water stress in 
						agriculture is to make more water available to crops. This hydrophile 
						strategy can be performed by either sowing crops selectively in well-watered 
						areas or mobilising water into drier land.
						|
						Another, more holistic strategy to cope with risk is to spread the investment 
						into multiple crops, environments, and agricultural land use practices. 
						By improving and maintaining agrodiversity the farming agent can buffer 
						the ﬂuctuations in yield of individual crops while also safeguarding the 
						future productivity of the entire food economy.
						The polyphile strategy is not embraced as a form of optimising agricultural 
						production in a given year, but as a way to safeguard enough production
						under inescapable uncertainties.
						|
						Although potentially leading to opposite practices,
						the hydrophile and polyphile risk mitigation strategies can be combined locally, 
						either as household or village-wide traditions.
						A composite approach will give a different weight to each of these strategies, 
						and would often include multiple rules-of-thumb speciﬁc to certain crops under 
						certain conditions.
						Additionally, farmers can incorporate speciﬁc practices that reduce the overall 
						risk by addressing other hazards, such as the use of manure and complementary 
						crops (e.g., legumes) to replenish soil fertility.
						Other more general risk mitigation strategies can also be added to the mix, 
						such as common pooling, planning for a fallback surplus, or improving long-term 
						storage infrastructure.

					<h3><i style="color: slateblue">Conclusions</i></h3>
					<ul style="font-size: 80%;">
						<li class="fragment"><i style="color: dodgerblue">Seasonality</i> matters</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i style="color: forestgreen">Low</i> and <i style="color: crimson">high</i>-risk crops</li>
						<li class="fragment"><i style="color: slateblue">Multi-cropping</i> and <i style="color: gold">risk mitigation</i></li>

							<i style="color: orange">land use</i></li>
					</ul>
						
					<aside class="notes">
						the first big lesson we learn is that seasonality does matter a lot when dealing with agricultural production.
						In this sense, ignoring the nuances of fine temporal resolution
						might push us towards critically mistaken interpretations.
						|
						The importance of the diversity of crops is also raised by our preliminary results, 
						even when using a very simple crop model.
						Most notably, there is a striking difference between low and high water sensitivity crops,
						which in a context like the Indus Basin translates as low and high risk for farmers.
						| 
						Given these results, we are eager to truly experiment with populations of farmers engaged in multi-cropping
						in order to further understand how and under which conditions multi-cropping enables risk mitigation.
						|
						Our next steps, that is to consolidate and integrate the remaining IndusVillage submodels, 
						will allow us to finally do just that.
